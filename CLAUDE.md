## Development Rules
- **NEVER create example files** (e.g., `*-example.tsx`, `*-demo.tsx`, `*-sandbox.tsx`)
- All components should be production-ready and self-documenting through proper TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
- Integration examples should be documented in README files or component JSDoc, not as separate example files
- NEVER expose the internal libraries in the index.ts
